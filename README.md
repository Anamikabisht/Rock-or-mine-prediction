Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine using logistic regression. The dataset consists of various features extracted from sonar signals, and the goal is to classify them accurately into one of two classes: "Rock" or "Mine". After training the logistic regression model, it achieved a testing accuracy of 76% and a training accuracy of 83%.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features derived from sonar signals, such as the frequency of the signal (F1-F60), along with the corresponding class labels: "R" (Rock) and "M" (Mine).

Methodology
1.Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset was loaded into Google Colab and preprocessed to handle missing values and encode the class labels.
2.Feature Engineering: Feature selection and transformation were performed to prepare the data for training.
3.Logistic Regression Model: Logistic regression, a widely-used classification algorithm, was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The model was trained on the preprocessed data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.
4.Model Evaluation: The trained logistic regression model was evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance. The accuracy metric was used to measure the model's ability to correctly classify instances.
5.Results: The logistic regression model achieved a testing accuracy of 76% and a training accuracy of 83%, indicating moderate performance in predicting whether sonar signals correspond to rocks or mines.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in classifying sonar signals to distinguish between rocks and mines. While the model achieved decent accuracy, further improvements could be explored by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, conducting feature engineering, and tuning hyperparameters.

Future Work
Potential avenues for future work include:

Exploring other classification algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines.
Conducting more in-depth feature engineering to extract more relevant information from the sonar signals.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the logistic regression model to optimize performance further.
Collecting additional data to improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model.
